Hi! 

In this project, im taking on the task of building a webscraper that scowers the web to collect data on bubble tea shops in london! 

I love tea so why not combine my love for tea with my desire to develop my coding abilities. 

The aim of this project is to: 
- Improve my ability to code in python. 
- Create a small program that collects data which I could use for my SQL and python projects.
