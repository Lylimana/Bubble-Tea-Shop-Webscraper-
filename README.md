Hi! 

In this project, im taking on the task of building a webscraper that scours the web to collect data on bubble tea shops in london! 

I love tea so why not combine my love for tea with my desire to develop my coding abilities. 

The aim of this project is to: 
- Improve my ability to code in python. 
- Create a small program that collects data which I could use for my SQL and python projects. 


Attempt 1: 
Attempted to create an a webscraper using "Building a Web Scraping Tool in Python | Step-by-Step Tutorial" by Masterng Programming. 

Was using this link as my target:

I ran the code but didn't receive any results on terminal. 

I figured this could be due to multiple reasons: 
- Wrong targets i.e. "class" 
- No variables being stored as a result hence no out put

Upon some research, I identified that most sites can potentially stop web scraping and could also be against terms of service. 


Plan of action: 
In my research I identified that a Google API could be used for web scraping which is a legal work around. 
The API in question is places API.
